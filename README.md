# Alexa-BehaviorTrees

This repository contains the research and practical application of Behavior Trees (BTs) in robotics and AI systems. 
The project explores the fundamentals of BTs, compares them with other decision-making architectures, and demonstrates their real-world applications through various scenarios. 

The optional part of this project covered a behavior tree for a robot whose aim is to pick up a ball and place it in a bin
The diagram for the tree is this one, which is also explained in the report.

# How to Run the Project

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Create a build directory and compile the project:
   ````
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ````
   
3. Once the build is complete, run the executable:
