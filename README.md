# Alexa-BehaviorTrees

This repository contains the research and practical application of Behavior Trees (BTs) in robotics and AI systems. 
The project explores the fundamentals of BTs, compares them with other decision-making architectures, and demonstrates their real-world applications through various scenarios. 

The optional part of this project covered a behavior tree for a robot whose aim is to pick up a ball and place it in a bin
The diagram for the tree is this one, which is also explained in the report.

to run the project, navigate to the project directory in the terminal, make a build directory and compile

```mkdir build && cd build
cmake..
make```

then run the executable by typing
